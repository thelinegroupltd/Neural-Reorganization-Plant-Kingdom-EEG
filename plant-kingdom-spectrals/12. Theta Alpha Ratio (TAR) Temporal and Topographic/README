This script quantifies the Theta–Alpha Ratio (TAR) as a derived spectral metric capturing the relative balance between theta-band and alpha-band power across time and scalp location. TAR is computed per channel, summarised using robust statistics (e.g., session medians), and visualised both temporally and topographically. The analysis includes raw TAR, log-transformed TAR, and baseline-normalised differences (ΔTAR and ΔlogTAR), enabling direct comparison between experimental conditions and a baseline eyes-closed reference.

Topographic maps depict the spatial distribution of TAR across the scalp, while temporal analyses track how the theta–alpha balance evolves over the session. By expressing TAR in both absolute and baseline-relative forms, the script separates stable spatial organisation from condition-driven modulation. Baseline normalisation anchors all comparisons to a physiologically coherent reference state, ensuring that observed effects reflect structured changes in oscillatory balance rather than raw power magnitude alone.
