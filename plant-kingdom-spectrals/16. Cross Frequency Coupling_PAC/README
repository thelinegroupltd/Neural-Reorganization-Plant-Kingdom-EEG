This script quantifies cross-frequency coupling (CFC) in the EEG band-power envelope domain, focusing on phase–amplitude coupling (PAC) between slower and faster oscillatory bands. It measures how the phase of a low-frequency band-power envelope (e.g., Theta or Alpha) modulates the amplitude of a higher-frequency band-power envelope (e.g., BetaH or Gamma). Coupling strength is computed using the Tort Modulation Index (MI), derived from Hilbert-based phase and amplitude estimates applied to Emotiv POW streams sampled at 8 Hz.

PAC is computed at the regional level by aggregating electrodes into frontal, temporal, central, parietal, and occipital groups to improve robustness and interpretability. The script produces both absolute PAC values for each session and baseline-referenced ΔPAC values relative to an eyes-closed baseline. Together, these outputs characterise the magnitude and spatial distribution of slow–fast coordination while remaining independent of raw EEG phase-locking analyses.
