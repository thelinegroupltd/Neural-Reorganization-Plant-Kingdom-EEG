This script quantifies the temporal evolution of signal complexity within canonical EEG frequency bands using windowed Shannon entropy. For each band (Theta, Alpha, BetaL, BetaH, Gamma), entropy is computed over sliding time windows and aggregated by cortical region (frontal, central, parietal, occipital, temporal). Values are normalised to enable direct comparison across regions and experimental conditions.

In addition to absolute entropy during the baseline condition, the script computes Δ entropy relative to the baseline median. This allows condition-specific deviations to be expressed relative to a physiologically grounded reference state. Entropy here captures the distributional unpredictability of band-limited power over time, providing a measure of signal organisation distinct from raw amplitude or phase-based metrics such as coherence.
