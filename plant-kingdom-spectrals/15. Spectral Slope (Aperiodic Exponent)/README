This script quantifies the aperiodic component of the EEG power spectrum, specifically the spectral slope (aperiodic exponent) and the associated aperiodic offset, across all channels and conditions. The spectral slope measures how power decays as a function of frequency in log–log space, capturing the background 1/f-like structure of the signal independently of narrowband oscillatory activity. The aperiodic offset reflects the vertical elevation of this background spectrum and provides complementary information about broadband power levels.

Channel-wise estimates of the aperiodic exponent and offset are derived from Welch power spectral density computed on raw EEG data. Outputs include absolute topographic maps of the exponent and offset, baseline-relative differences (ΔExponent vs eyes-closed baseline), and a normalised slope deviation metric (NASS), where ΔExponent is scaled by the baseline interquartile range. Diagnostic scatter plots of log–log power versus frequency are also generated to verify linearity and stability of the slope fit across channels.

Together, these outputs characterise spatial and condition-dependent changes in the background spectral organisation of the EEG, providing a complementary perspective to band-specific power analyses.
