This script quantifies the temporal stability of derived EEG measures by measuring how long key signal properties persist over time. Rather than focusing on instantaneous values, spatial distributions, or relative magnitudes, it characterises the time scale over which entropy- and ratio-based metrics evolve, decorrelate, and remain biased relative to baseline reference levels.

Two complementary persistence measures are implemented. Autocorrelation decay time (τ, defined at the 1/e point) estimates how long a signal remains statistically similar to its recent past, providing a characteristic temporal memory for each metric. Mean dwell time measures the average duration that a signal remains continuously above a baseline-derived anchor, typically the median of a resting reference condition, capturing sustained regime occupancy rather than transient excursions.

These measures are applied to band-limited Shannon entropy time series at the regional level and to the global theta–alpha ratio (TAR), enabling persistence to be examined across frequency bands, cortical regions, and environments. All outputs are expressed in seconds, making the results directly interpretable as time-based properties of neural dynamics rather than abstract indices.
