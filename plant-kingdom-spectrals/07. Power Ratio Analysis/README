This script measures the time-resolved relative composition of EEG spectral power by computing ratios between band-limited power envelopes rather than analysing absolute band power. Using Theta, Alpha, BetaL, BetaH, and Gamma envelopes, it derives both single-band ratios and inter-band ratios (e.g., Alpha/Theta, Beta/Alpha, Gamma/Beta) to characterise how spectral energy is distributed across frequencies at each moment in time.

Ratios are computed across all channels and summarised using the median to reduce sensitivity to outlier electrodes and localised artefacts. Two aggregation strategies are implemented:

Median of ratios, where ratios are calculated at the channel level and then aggregated.

Ratio of medians, where band medians are computed first and ratios are formed afterward.

This dual approach allows inspection of whether observed patterns depend on aggregation order.

In addition to absolute ratio time series, the script computes baseline-anchored difference (Δ) ratios, expressing session values relative to the median ratio observed during an eyes-closed baseline. These Δ plots quantify how far and in what direction the session’s spectral composition departs from baseline, independent of absolute power scale.
