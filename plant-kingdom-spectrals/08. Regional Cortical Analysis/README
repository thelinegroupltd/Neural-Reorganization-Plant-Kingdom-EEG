This script analyses how EEG band-limited power evolves when signals are aggregated at the level of anatomically defined cortical regions rather than individual electrodes. Band-power envelopes (Theta, Alpha, BetaL, BetaH, Gamma; sampled at 8 Hz) are grouped into coarse cortical regions, including frontal, parietal, temporal, occipital, and sensorimotor subdivisions. Within each region, channel-level variability is collapsed using a robust statistic (median), producing a single representative timecourse per region and frequency band.

All values are baseline-normalised using z-scores relative to an eyes-closed reference condition, allowing deviations to be interpreted as increases or decreases from resting cortical activity. The script generates multiple complementary outputs: dense regional timecourses preserving full temporal structure, region × band heatmaps summarising spatial organisation across time, and regional summary bar charts quantifying average magnitude and effect ordering. Together, these outputs characterise the regional magnitude, temporal stability, and spatial distribution of band-power modulation across experimental conditions.
