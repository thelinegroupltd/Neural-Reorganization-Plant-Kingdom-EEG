This script quantifies the rate and structure of change in neural state composition over time by measuring how EEG-derived state vectors evolve within a high-dimensional feature space. Rather than analysing absolute power, entropy, or spatial configuration at isolated time points, it computes state-to-state displacement between successive windows. Displacement is expressed using complementary metrics, including L2 distance (magnitude of reorganisation) and cosine similarity (directional consistency of change), and is evaluated both globally and relative to entropy and regional structure.

The outputs characterise how quickly and how coherently the brain reorganises its spectral–spatial configuration. Time-series plots capture instantaneous and sustained reorganisation velocity, while distributional and joint visualisations (e.g., entropy × flux) reveal the dynamical regimes in which these transitions occur. The script therefore measures neural dynamics—movement through state space—rather than static neural content.
