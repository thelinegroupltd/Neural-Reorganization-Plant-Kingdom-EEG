This script quantifies how EEG signal power is distributed across frequencies using power spectral density (PSD) estimates derived from raw EEG via Welch’s method. It computes absolute spectral power to characterise the overall spectral shape, slope, and dominant frequency components of the signal, and relative (baseline-normalised) PSD to express frequency-specific changes in power with respect to an eyes-closed resting baseline.

The analysis operates at two levels: continuous frequency spectra and band-integrated power across canonical EEG bands. This allows inspection of broadband spectral structure as well as band-specific contributions. Channel-wise PSDs are summarised using robust statistics (median and interquartile range), enabling assessment of central tendencies and spatial variability without undue influence from outlier electrodes.
