This script quantifies how the organisation of spectral power across frequency bands changes at the level of individual EEG channels relative to a baseline reference. Rather than focusing on absolute band-power magnitudes or time-resolved dynamics, it examines how the relative balance of frequency bands within each channel is redistributed under different conditions.

The analysis operates in the frequency × channel domain using median band-power values aggregated across time. Absolute band × channel heatmaps provide a stable representation of spectral structure for baseline, indoor, and outdoor conditions. These are complemented by baseline-normalised Δlog10 maps that express relative increases or decreases in band power with respect to baseline EC on a symmetric logarithmic scale.

In addition, the script computes a channel-wise reorganisation index using Jensen–Shannon distance between per-channel band-power distributions. Band-power values are normalised within each channel to form a probability distribution across bands before divergence is calculated. This index collapses the multi-band structure at each channel into a single scalar that captures how different the shape of the band distribution is from baseline, independent of absolute power scaling. In this way, the script explicitly separates amplitude changes from distributional reconfiguration.
