This script quantifies and visualizes two complementary descriptors of EEG spectral structure across channels and scalp topology: spectral flatness and the spectral edge frequency at 90% cumulative power (SEF90). Spectral flatness is computed within canonical frequency bands as an absolute measure, capturing the extent to which band activity is broadband (noise-like) versus spectrally concentrated (oscillatory) at each electrode. SEF90 is computed as an absolute frequency metric representing the frequency below which 90% of the total spectral power is contained.

Together, these measures characterise both the structural shape of the spectrum (flatness) and the cumulative distribution of spectral power across frequencies (SEF90). The script generates channel-level summaries and interpolated topographic maps for baseline, indoor, and outdoor conditions, along with condition-difference maps where applicable. This enables spatial inspection of broadband structure and frequency redistribution across the scalp without conflating spectral composition with raw power magnitude.
