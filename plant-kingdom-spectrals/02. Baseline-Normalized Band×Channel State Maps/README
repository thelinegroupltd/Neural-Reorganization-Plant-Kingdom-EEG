This script characterizes the global spectral state of each session by comparing band-limited EEG power to a resting Eyes-Closed baseline. For every frequency band and EEG channel, band-power values are aggregated across the full session and normalized as z-scores relative to the baseline distribution. The output is a set of band × channel heatmaps representing persistent, session-wide deviations from baseline rather than transient or time-localized effects. By collapsing temporal structure, the script is designed to capture overall state bias rather than dynamics, variability, or moment-to-moment fluctuations.

In practical terms, the script measures the mean operating regime of the system during a session. Each heatmap answers a single question: on average, was power in a given frequency band at a given channel higher or lower than expected under baseline resting conditions? Warm values indicate sustained elevation relative to baseline, cool values indicate sustained suppression, and near-zero values indicate baseline-like behavior. Because normalization is performed channel-wise against a common baseline reference, spatial structure in the maps reflects how different regions contribute to the session-level spectral state.
