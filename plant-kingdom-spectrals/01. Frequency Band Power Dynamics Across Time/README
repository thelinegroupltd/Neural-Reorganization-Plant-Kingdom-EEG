This script computes time-resolved band-limited EEG power (Theta, Alpha, BetaL, BetaH, Gamma) across channels relative to a resting baseline. It operates on Emotiv POW.* band-power streams (8 Hz cadence) and expresses activity as z-scored deviations from baseline to enable direct condition comparison.

Outputs include:

Time × channel heatmaps for each frequency band

Condition difference maps (Outdoor − Indoor)

Baseline-normalised power trajectories across the full session

Unlike summary-based analyses, this script preserves full temporal structure rather than collapsing signals into averages. This enables inspection of:

Persistence and stability of band-power deviations

Spatial distribution across channels

Temporal variability within and between conditions

In effect, this module provides a time-resolved, spatially explicit representation of large-scale spectral activity across canonical EEG frequency bands.
