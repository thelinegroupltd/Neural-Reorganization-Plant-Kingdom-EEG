This script characterises the extrema structure of band-limited EEG activity by detecting and analysing salient local maxima in power-envelope time series. Rather than measuring continuous power or average oscillatory strength, it isolates discrete peak events that exceed baseline-referenced statistical thresholds. Salience is defined relative to the eyes-closed baseline using a median absolute deviation (MAD) framework, ensuring that only peaks meaningfully distinct from resting-state variability are retained.

The script quantifies these events along three complementary dimensions. First, salient maxima density maps where and when statistically prominent peaks occur across channels and time. Second, population synchrony measures the proportion of channels exhibiting a salient peak within each time bin, capturing moments of coordinated multi-channel engagement. Third, K_MAD threshold sweeps evaluate how the detected peak structure changes as the salience criterion is systematically tightened, providing a robustness check against threshold-dependent artefacts.

Together, these outputs describe the temporal sparsity, spatial distribution, co-occurrence structure, and threshold stability of peak-like dynamics within each frequency band and session condition.
