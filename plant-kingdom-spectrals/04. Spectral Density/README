POW FFT Envelope Domain

This component computes the power spectral density (PSD) of band-power envelopes rather than the raw EEG signal. Welch PSD estimation is applied to the time series of band-limited power (theta, alpha, beta, gamma), allowing quantification of how power within each band fluctuates over time. The analysis therefore operates in the modulation-frequency domain, not the carrier-frequency domain.

The script generates absolute envelope PSDs for baseline, indoor, and outdoor conditions. It also computes log-scaled (dB) differences relative to an eyes-closed baseline and between experimental environments. Spectra are summarised as the median across channels with inter-quartile ranges (25–75%) to represent spatial dispersion while reducing sensitivity to individual electrode outliers.

This module characterises temporal organisation of band-power dynamics rather than instantaneous oscillatory frequency content.

Raw EEG Domain

This component computes the power spectral density (PSD) of the raw EEG signal using Welch’s method in the conventional carrier-frequency domain. It quantifies how signal energy is distributed across frequencies from delta through gamma during baseline, indoor, and outdoor conditions.

The script produces both absolute PSD profiles and log-scaled (dB) comparisons relative to an eyes-closed baseline and between environments. As with the envelope domain, spectra are summarised using the median across channels with inter-quartile ranges to provide a robust global representation while retaining spatial variability information.

Unlike the envelope-domain analysis, this module reflects the oscillatory content of the EEG signal itself rather than the temporal modulation of band power.
