# Neural-Reorganization-Plant-Kingdom-EEG

This repository contains the full analysis of EEG data from the Plant Kingdom sessions for the paper "Neural Reorganisation During Monroe Institute Hemi-Sync Inner Earth ‘Plant Kingdom’ Sessions A Multiscale EEG Analysis". The analysis focuses on neural reorganization during Monroe Institute Hemi-Sync Inner Earth sessions and includes multiscale analyses of spectral dynamics, entropy, cross-frequency coupling, and state-space flux in the context of environmental influence on brain activity.

Directory Structure

Below is an overview of the folder contents:

01. Frequency Band Power Dynamics Across Time

This folder contains analysis of the power dynamics across various frequency bands (Theta, Alpha, Beta, Gamma) over time. It explores the evolution of power in these bands and their temporal fluctuations during the sessions.

02. Baseline-Normalized Band × Channel State Maps

Contains the baseline-normalized power values across all EEG channels and frequency bands. This normalization process helps compare the session data to resting (baseline) conditions, providing insights into deviations from baseline brain activity.

03. Phase and Coherence

This section analyzes the phase relationships and coherence between different frequency bands. It explores the synchrony between brain regions and the coupling between different oscillatory frequencies across time.

04. Spectral Density

This folder includes calculations of the spectral density, providing insights into the distribution of power across frequencies. It is a key measure of how power is spread across various frequency bands during the sessions.

05. Correlation Between Bands and Markers

Examines the correlation between different frequency bands and specific event markers within the sessions, linking changes in brain activity with marked occurrences during the Hemi-Sync sessions.

06. Entropy and Complexity Metrics Separate

This section includes entropy and complexity analysis, offering a quantitative assessment of the unpredictability and organization of neural activity. Separate files cover Shannon entropy and Lempel-Ziv complexity for each frequency band.

07. Power Ratio Analysis

Power ratio analysis compares the relative power between different frequency bands to identify dynamic shifts in brain activity, providing further insight into spectral reorganization during the sessions.

08. Regional Cortical Analysis

Focuses on analyzing brain activity by cortical region. This section divides the EEG data into regions (frontal, occipital, temporal, etc.) to explore how activity differs across different areas of the brain.

09. Local Maxima Structure

This analysis identifies local maxima within the power spectra, helping to pinpoint specific regions where peak power concentrations occur. It is useful for understanding the finer details of spectral distribution across time.

10. Absolute and Relative Power Spectral Density (PSD)

Includes both absolute and relative power spectral density calculations, providing insights into both the overall and relative changes in spectral power compared to baseline conditions.

11. SEF90 and Spectral Flatness

This section contains the Spectral Edge Frequency (SEF90) analysis and spectral flatness metrics, which describe the smoothness and the frequency distribution characteristics of the EEG signal.

12. Theta Alpha Ratio (TAR) Temporal and Topographic

Focuses on the ratio between theta and alpha frequencies, providing insights into the topographic distribution of this ratio across brain regions. This is particularly important for understanding the balance of neural states during the sessions.

13. Shannon Entropy (Windowed, Band-Limited)

This section explores the Shannon entropy of band-limited power envelopes, which quantifies the unpredictability or variability within each frequency band over time.

14. Frequency × Channel Reorganisation

Examines how the EEG signal reorganizes across frequency bands and spatial channels, helping to identify how brain activity changes both temporally and spatially during the sessions.

15. Spectral Slope (Aperiodic Exponent)

Includes analysis of the spectral slope, which provides information on the aperiodic component of the EEG signal. This is a key feature for understanding the dynamics of neural oscillations.

16. Cross-Frequency Coupling (PAC)

This section includes phase-amplitude coupling (PAC) analysis, a key measure of cross-frequency interactions, showing how lower-frequency phase modulates the amplitude of higher-frequency bands.

17. Temporal Stability - Persistence Index

Focuses on temporal stability and persistence measures, quantifying how long specific neural states persist and remain stable across time.

18. Reorganisation Velocity (State-Space Flux)

This section examines the speed of state-space reorganization, measuring how rapidly the brain's activity state changes over time. It provides a key measure of neural dynamics and how the system reorganizes in response to different environmental conditions.
