# Neural-Reorganization-Plant-Kingdom-EEG
This repository contains the analysis of EEG data from the Plant Kingdom sessions, focusing on neural reorganization during Monroe Institute Hemi-Sync Inner Earth sessions. It includes multiscale analyses of spectral dynamics, entropy, cross-frequency coupling, and state-space flux in the context of environmental influence on brain activity.
